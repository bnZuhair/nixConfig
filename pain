I really wich that the S-key will give you the result of the letter that is equevlant to the key you pressed if pressed with shift
or any thing that tells us how to show something link ( or ) or any of the symples







This is used for testing prepesoes I want it to be perfict

This should work by now:
![{('?)}]|
&%_^#*$=+:
-`~<\/>'.@
and I think that this should be changed
